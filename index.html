						<em>The Call of the Wild</em> (1903) and <em>White Fang</em> (1906) are
						world famous animal stories. Set in Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush 
						of the late 1890s, <em>The Call of the Wild</em> is about Buck, the
						magnificent cross-bred offspring of a St Bernard and a Scottish Collie.
						Stolen from his pampered life on a Californian esatate and shipped to the
						Klondike to work as a sledge dog, he triumphs over his circumstances and
						becomes the leader of a wolf pack. The story records the 'decivilisation'
						of Buck as he answers 'the call of the wild', an inherent memory of
						primeval origins to which he instinctively responds. In contrast,
						<em>White Fang</em> relates the tale of a wolf born and bred in the wild
						which is civilised by the master he comes to trust and love.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The brutal world of the Klondike miners and their dogs is
						brilliantly evoked and Jack London's rendering of the sentient life
						of Buck and White Fang as they confront their destiny is enthralling
						and convincing. The deeper resonance of these stories derives from
						the author's use of the myth of the hero who survives by strength
						and courage, a powerful myth that still appeals to our collective
						unconscious.
